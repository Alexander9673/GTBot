# GTBot
 A Web-based Growtopia Bot.

## How it works
Basically, a NodeJS app is created, which acts as a ENet Client and also a Websocket server. It's a proxy to make communication from the website to ENet.  

It uses websockets to communicate to make it easier, and since js on web only supports tcp.
